# PE ratio

* PE ratio is the most widely used parameter to analyse whether the stock of any company is overvalued or undervalued at any point in time.
* It is calculated by dividing the current market price (CMP) of stock by profit/earnings per share (EPS).

> To illustrate, if the PE is 10, it means that to get ₹1 of earnings in one year from a company, the investor is paying ₹10.
