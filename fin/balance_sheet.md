## Balance Sheet

* Balance sheet refers to a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity at a specific point in time.
* The balance sheet adheres to an equation that equates assets with the sum of liabilities and shareholder equity.
> ` Assets = Liabilities + Shareholdersâ€™ Equity `

* **Shareholder equity** is the money attributable to the owners of a business or its shareholders. It is also known as net assets since it is equivalent to the total assets of a company minus its liabilities or the debt it owes to non-shareholders.

* **Retained earnings** are the net earnings a company either reinvests in the business or uses to pay off debt. The remaining amount is distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.
