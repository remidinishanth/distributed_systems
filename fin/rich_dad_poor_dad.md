### Assets: Put money into my pockets.

Rich people focus on building their assets.

“An asset, whether you’re working or not, is something that puts money in your pocket.”

### Liabilities: Take money out of my pockets

### Rule #1:

* You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.
* If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is rule number one.
* It is the only rule. This may sound absurdly simple, but most people have no idea how profound this rule is.
* Most people struggle financially because they do not know the difference between an asset and a liability.
* “Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets.”

> The poor and middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.

‘The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.’


### “Why the Rich gets Richer?”

The asset column generates more than enough income to cover the expenses, with the balance reinvested into the asset column. 

The asset column continues to grow and therefore, the income it produces grows with it. The result is that rich gets richer!

* The rich buy assets
* The poor only have expenses
* The middle class buy liabilities they think are assets

> Rich dad believed that the words ‘I can’t afford it' shut down your brain. ‘How can I afford it?’ opens up possibilities, excitement, and dreams.

> The key to financial freedom and great wealth is a person’s ability to convert earned income into passive and/or portfolio income.

### Getting Started

* **Find a reason greater than reality**: the power of spirit. Strong sense of purpose is needed to do most things in life.
* **Make daily choices**: the power of choice. We make a choice of what to think, what to do with our time and money, and so on.
* **Choose friends carefully**: the power of association. Having rich friends means you can learn from them about money.
* **Master a formula and then learn a new one**: the power of learning quickly. Being careful about what we study is important because we become what we study.
  
Rather than what we know, how fast we learn is more important in the information age.

“When you know you are ignorant in a subject, start educating yourself by finding an expert in the field or a book on the subject.”


* Pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline. Self-control and a high tolerance for financial pressure are necessary to become rich.
* Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus. Use assets instead of liabilities to buy luxuries.
