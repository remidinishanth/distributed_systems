## ARR

* Annual Recurring Revenue(ARR) is a key metric used by subscription-based SaaS companies using term-based agreements.
* ARR normalizes the contracted recurring revenue components of term subscriptions to a one-year period.
* An alternative to monthly recurring revenue MRR, ARR is used almost **exclusively in B2B subscription** businesses with **multi-year agreements** to help financial leaders understand their annual revenue and visualize company growth year over year.

## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

* How much is an average new customer value to your business?
* Customer lifetime value is more valuable as a metric when you calculate its ratio to customer acquisition cost (CAC).
