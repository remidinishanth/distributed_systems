### NAS

The NAS device itself is a network node—much like computers and other TCP/IP devices, all of which maintain their own IP address—and the NAS file service uses the ethernet network to send and receive files. 

This system employs protocols like 
* Network File System (NFS) and
* Server Message Block (SMB),

enabling seamless data exchange between multiple users.

## Thick provisioning vs Thin provisioning

Thin provisioning can introduce higher latency compared to thick provisioning due to the on-the-fly allocation of storage space and potential need for zeroing out blocks before writing data.
