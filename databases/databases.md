## Types of datastore:
Databases come in a variety of genres, such as 
* Relational (Postgres),
* Key-Value (Riak, Redis, Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB),
* Columnar - stores data in columns instead of rows (HBase),
* Document-oriented (MongoDB, CouchDB), and
* Graph (Neo4J).

### Relational

Relational database management systems (RDBMSs)
are set-theory-based systems implemented as two-dimensional tables with
rows and columns. The canonical means of interacting with an RDBMS is by
writing queries in Structured Query Language (SQL).

Importantly, tables can join and morph
into new, more complex tables, because of their mathematical basis in relational (set) theory.

Examples: MySQL, H2, HSQLDB, SQLite and Postgres.
