## Goal

>  Goal: How can we build an ultra-high performance, low-latency multi-table database that can grow incrementally to handle massive-scale data?


## Abstract

* Cassandra is a distributed storage system for managing very
large amounts of structured data spread out across many
commodity servers, while providing highly available service
with no single point of failure.
* Cassandra system was designed to run on
cheap commodity hardware and handle high write through-
put while not sacrificing read efficiency
