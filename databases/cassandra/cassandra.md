### Goal

>  Goal: How can we build an ultra-high performance, low-latency multi-table database that can grow incrementally to handle massive-scale data?

Cassandra is a large-scale open-source NoSQL wide-column distributed database. It was developed at Facebook and its design was influenced by Amazon Dynamo and Google Bigtable.

### Abstract

* Cassandra is a distributed storage system for managing very
large amounts of structured data spread out across many
commodity servers, while providing highly available service
with no single point of failure.

* Cassandra system was designed to run on
cheap commodity hardware and handle high write through-
put while not sacrificing read efficiency

### Introduction

* Cassandra was designed to fulfill the storage needs of the Inbox Search problem.
  * Enables users to search through their Facebook Inbox.
* This involves storing reverse indices of Facebook messages that users send and receive. A reverse index maps message contents to messages. That is, the system can look up a word and find all messages that contain text with that word in it 
  
* At Facebook this meant the system was required to handle a very high write throughput, billions
of writes per day, and also scale with the number of users.


* The key goals of Cassandra were high performance, incremental scalability, and high availability. Since the CAP theorem tells us we must choose between consistency and availability if a network partition occurs, Cassandra opted for high availability at the expense of consistency, implementing an eventually consistent model.
* This also helps with performance since there is no need to take and release locks across all nodes that store replicas of data thatâ€™s being modified.
