### Types of Databases
Selecting the right database is crucial for project success. Here's a summary of key points:

- SQL databases offer structured data storage, SQL support, and relational capabilities.
- NoSQL databases provide flexibility, scalability, and distributed architectures.
- Specialized databases like columnar, graph, spatial, and time-series cater to specific needs.
- Evaluate key features, benefits, and providers to make an informed decision.

#### Vector DB

A vector database indexes and stores vector embeddings for fast retrieval and similarity search, with capabilities like CRUD operations, metadata filtering, and horizontal scaling.

A vector database stores high-dimensional vectors extracted from various unstructured data, like audio, video, image, and text. Then we can calculate the similarity among unstructured data. Typical use cases include:

- finding similar images or text
- recommending similar products
- detecting abnormalities
- temporarily store embeddings for large amounts of input
