## SQL

### Atomicity (all-or-nothing guarantee)
Atomicity: The system can only be in the state it was before the operation or after the operation, not something in between.

In the context of ACID, atomicity is not about concurrency. It does not describe what happens if several processes try to access the same data at the same time, because that is covered under the letter I, for isolation.

Atomicity simplifies this problem: if a transaction was aborted, the application can be sure that it didn‚Äôt change anything, so it can safely be retried.

### Consistency

The idea of ACID consistency is that you have certain statements about your data (invariants) that must always be true ‚Äî for example, in an accounting system, credits and debits across all accounts must always be balanced.

However, this idea of consistency depends on the application‚Äôs notion of invariants, and it‚Äôs the application‚Äôs responsibility to define its transactions correctly so that they preserve consistency. 

Atomicity, isolation, and durability are properties of the database, whereas consis‚Äê tency (in the ACID sense) is a property of the application.

### Isolation levels

Concurrently running transactions shouldn‚Äôt interfere with each other. For example, if one transaction makes several writes, then another transaction should see either all or none of those writes, but not some subset.

üîπ Serializalble: This is the highest isolation level. Concurrent transactions are guaranteed to be executed in sequence.

üîπ Repeatable Read: Data read during the transaction stays the same as the transaction starts.

üîπ Read Committed: Data modification can only be read after the transaction is committed.

üîπ Read Uncommitted: The data modification can be read by other transactions before a transaction is committed.

#### Dirty Read

Violating isolation: one transaction reads another transaction‚Äôs uncommitted writes (a ‚Äúdirty read‚Äù)

No need to even write, you can just read too and you might end up reading uncommitted write
