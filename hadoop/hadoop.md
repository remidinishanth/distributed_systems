* Hadoop is a sturdy, scalable computing platform
that provides a distributed file system and MapReduce capabilities.
* Wherever you find HBase, youâ€™ll find Hadoop and other infrastructural components that
you can use in your own applications, such as Apache Hive, a data warehousing
tool, and Apache Pig, a parallel processing tool (and many others).
