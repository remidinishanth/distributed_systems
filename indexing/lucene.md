### Indexing
Simply put, Lucene uses an “inverted indexing” of data – instead of mapping pages to keywords, it maps keywords to pages just like a glossary at the end of any book.

This allows for faster search responses, as it searches through an index, instead of searching through text directly.

Lucene stores documents as an “inverted index”, in that it keeps track of the list of unique words per document (so words to documents, as opposed to documents to words).
