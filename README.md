 * An increasingly popular approach to tailor APIs to individual use cases is to use graph-based
  APIs. A graph-based API exposes a schema composed of types,
  fields, and relationships across types. The API allows a client to
  declare what data it needs and make a request.
 * It provides a schema of the data in the API and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need.

CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation.  At its heart is the notion that you can use a different model to update information than the model you use to read information. Many systems do fit a CRUD mental model, and so should be done in that style. There is an inherent
replication lag between the time a change has been applied on the write path and the read path has received and applied it, which
makes the system sequentially consistent. Ref: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html
* This is used in URL shortener, once we shorten the URL, we don't update the same shortened-url.

#### Sharding Strategies of key-value store
* The mapping between keys and partitions, and other metadata, is
typically maintained in a strongly-consistent configuration store,
like etcd or Zookeeper.
* Ideally, if a partition is added, only ùêæ/ùëÅ keys should be shuffled
around, where ùêæ is the number of keys and ùëÅ the number of
partitions. A hashing strategy that guarantees this property is
called stable hashing. Ring hashing is an example of stable hashing. With ring hashing,
a function maps a key to a point on a circle. The circle is then split
into partitions that can be evenly or pseudo-randomly spaced, depending on the specific algorithm. When a new partition is added,
it can be shown that most keys don‚Äôt need to be shuffled around. E.g Consistent Hashing.

A Range of Interesting Problems for Distributed System Designers
* Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Systems [Gnutella, Kazaa, BitTorrent]
* Cloud Infrastructures [AWS, Azure, Google Cloud]
* Cloud Storage [Key-Value stores, NoSQL, Cassandra]
* Cloud Programming [MapReduce, Storm, Pregel]
* Coordination [Paxos, Leader Election, Snapshots]
* Managing many clients and Servers Concurrently [Concurrency Control, Replication Control]

Core Concepts of Distributed Systems
* Gossip
* Membership
* Distributed Hash Tables(DHTs)

Peer-to-peer systems use DHTs, Key-Value/NoSQL stores uses DHTs, gossip, membership.
