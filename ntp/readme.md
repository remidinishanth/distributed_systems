Chrony is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP). You can use Chrony:

* to synchronize the system clock with NTP servers,
* to synchronize the system clock with a reference clock, for example a GPS receiver,
* to synchronize the system clock with a manual time input,
* as an NTPv4(RFC 5905) server or peer to provide a time service to other computers in the network.
