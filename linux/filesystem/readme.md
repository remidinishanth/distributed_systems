LVM creates a logical volume that aggregates multiple disks to stripe reads and writes. 
It also serves as a scalable volume for maintenance.

* Logical Volume Manager (LVM) plays an important role in the Linux operating system by improving the availability, disk I/O, performance and capability of disk management.

* LVM is a widely used technique that is extremely flexible for disk management.

* This adds an extra layer between the physical disks and the file system, allowing you to create a logical volume instead of a physical disk.
