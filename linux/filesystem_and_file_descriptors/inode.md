## 📂 What Data is Stored in an Inode?

An **inode** (index node) is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a file-system object like a file or a directory. Below is a breakdown of what attributes are actually stored within the inode itself versus what is stored elsewhere.

| Data Attribute | Stored? | Explanation / Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Filename** | ❌ No | Filenames are stored in **directories**, mapping names to inode numbers. |
| **Containing Directory** | ❌ No | A file can be in multiple directories (via hard links), so the inode does not track a specific parent. |
| **File Size** | ✅ Yes | Stores the size of the file in bytes. |
| **File Type** | ✅ Yes | Identifies if it is a regular file, directory, character device, etc. |
| **# of Soft Links** | ❌ No | Soft links are distinct files; the target inode does not track how many soft links point to it. |
| **Location of Soft Links** | ❌ No | The inode is unaware of where soft links pointing to it are located. |
| **# of Hard Links** | ✅ Yes | Used to track reference counts. The file is only deleted when this count reaches 0. |
| **Location of Hard Links** | ❌ No | The inode knows *how many* exist, but not *where* they are in the directory tree. |
| **Access Rights** | ✅ Yes | Stores permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Execute for User/Group/Others). |
| **Timestamps** | ✅ Yes | Tracks creation (ctime), modification (mtime), and access (atime) times. |
| **File Contents** | ⚠️ Sometimes | Generally **No** (data is in blocks), but some file systems store very small files directly in the inode (inline data). |
| **Ordered List of Data Blocks** | ✅ Yes | Contains pointers to the disk blocks where the actual file content resides. |
