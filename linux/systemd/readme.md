## Systemd

Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems, primarily functioning as the init system that starts and manages user space processes

Systemd acts as PID 1, meaning it's the first process started by the kernel, and it's responsible for bringing up and maintaining other services. 

While Systemd has become the standard, some distributions still use `SysV` or `LSB` init scripts.
