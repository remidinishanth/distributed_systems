### Volume Server

In SeaweedFS, a volume is a single file consisting of many small files. When a master server starts, it sets the volume file maximum size to 30GB (see: -volumeSizeLimitMB). At volume server initialization, it will create 8 of these volumes (see: -max).

Each volume has its own TTL and replication.
