A fundamental difference between segments in a hierarchical database and tables in a relational database is that, in a hierarchical database, segments are implicitly joined with each other. In a relational database, you must explicitly join two tables. A segment instance in a hierarchical database is already joined with its parent segment and its child segments, which are all along the same hierarchical path. In a relational database, this relationship between tables is captured by foreign keys and primary keys.
