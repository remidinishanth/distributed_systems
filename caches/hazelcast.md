* With Hazelcast Platform, nodes automatically discover and join the cluster as you grow it to meet increasing demands for low-latency performance, greater data volumes, and stricter SLAs.
* Hazelcast clusters have no single-point-of-failure.
* Their peer-to-peer network forms the basis for a robust scale-out caching solution.
